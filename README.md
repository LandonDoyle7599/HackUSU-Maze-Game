# HackUSU-Maze-Game
Gyroscope Based Randomly Generated Maze Game for Android

I built this project in a team of 4 during the 24 hour HackUSU competition. We used git to simultaneoulsy develop various aspects of the project while working together to write various algorithms and debug issues. I worked as the project manager directing the efforts of various team members throughout development while also leading brainstorming sessions and handling communication with the event organizers and judges to prepare us for our presentation of the project.
